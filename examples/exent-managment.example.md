Happy to help,

The the events that I have been involved in through the years, I have developed an approach that has worked rather well:

Make an adaptive plan based on prior experience that best anticipates the potential challenges that may be experienced.

Work toward that plan and allow yourself to adjust as you gain more knowledge and encounter different challenges along the way.

As you get closer to the event, give yourself time to relax and have a think about what could go wrong and come up with ideas on how you will address those challenges should they arise.

Right before the event, run a double check to make sure you have everything you need and that it is organized in a manor that you can grab it at a moments notice.

During the event, grab yourself an extra bit of zip-ties, clear your mind, and get to it. As things come up, with a clear mind you can find the appropriate solution that will allow the event to progress unhindered.

After the event, have a celebratory pint, and get some sleep. Then document your experience, challenges face, possible solutions, and finally a very basic plan for how you will do things next year.

On the following year, pull out your plan and review, revise as needed, and get to work.

Most of all, don't panic, bring a towel!

Cheers
